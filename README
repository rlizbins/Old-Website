This is my personal website that is completely coded in pure html and css. Baked from scratch :D

I decided to make a personal website for part3 of the static web project assignment.

I utilized my knowledge of html and css to make 6 different html pages integrated with customized css. 

I included a home, about, interests, social, education, and contact page. 

I also used my understanding of layouts, color schemes, and spacing to make my pages appealing. 

I really enjoyed this assignment and I hope to continue working more on this project as I gain and learn new ideas and skills!
